Sponsorship for Festivals. These cultural programs bring much joy, magic and sparkle into these underprivileged children and families lives. They have no backup or extra to spend and many kids miss out. Our main programs include dancing, music, art, maybe small gifts and fruit or sweets prasad. For example Diwali, Navaratri, Holi, Janmashtami Krishna birthday and Freedom Fighters day.
